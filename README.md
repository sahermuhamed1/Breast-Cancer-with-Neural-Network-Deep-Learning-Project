# Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Network |  Deep Learning ProjectðŸ§ 

This project aims to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using a neural network implemented with deep learning techniques.

## Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection and classification of tumors are crucial for effective treatment and prognosis. In this project, we leverage deep learning methodologies to develop a classification model that can accurately predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on input features extracted from breast cancer biopsy images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, available through the sklearn library in python and to upload it in your notebbook you should run this code:
```python
breast_dataset = sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()
breast_dataset
```

## Neural Network Architecture

The neural network architecture comprises multiple layers of densely connected nodes, including input, hidden, and output layers. We employ techniques such as ReLU activation and sigmoid activation for the output layer. The model is trained using backpropagation and optimized using adam is optimizer.

## Performance Evaluation

The performance of the classification model is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, loss. We also visualize the model's learning curve and confusion matrix to gain insights into its performance and behavior.

## Usage

To run the project:

1. upload the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset or use a preprocessed version.
2. Train the neural network model by running the training script.
3. Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation script.
4. Experiment with different hyperparameters, architectures, and optimization techniques to improve performance.
